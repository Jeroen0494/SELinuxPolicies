# MLS policy
Remember, MLS only really works on a headless machine. In this example a CentOS 6.7 headless install was used.

## Conclusion
MLS on RHEL6 is difficult to setup, let alone maintain. Thare are a lot of security features in MLS that aren't documented causing constant headaches. Policy configuration examples are hard to find, your best bet would be to git clone the Reference Policy or Fedora Policy that has MLS support and start looking around.

The policy doesn't compile. There are a lot of mistakes in it. Don't use it as a complete reference. Use The SELinux Notebook.
